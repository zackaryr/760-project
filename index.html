    <h1>The Impact of COVID-19 on Student Enrollment and Performance</h1>
    <p class="intro">The purpose of this dashboard is to provide context to the impact COVID-19 has had on student enrollment and performance.
        With each graph, there will be a introductory explanation of what you are looking, explanation of how to read and interact with the graph, and our personal conclusions after viewing the data.
        Our visualizations are split between this webpage and Tableau.
        Please view our Tableau visualizations below.

    <p class="tooltip">Percentages are shown as a fraction. For example: 0.36 = 36%</p>

    <p>Michigan School Data<br><br>
        This chart shows the amount of dropouts for each graduation cohort.<br><br>
        Example from mischooldata.org: Students in the 2018 cohort were ninth graders in the 2014-15 school year.
        Their on-time expected graduation was four years later (2018).
        Students in this cohort who graduated in 2018 were counted in the four-year graduation rate; those who did not graduate in 2018 could be counted as dropouts or off-track continuing.
        Five- and six-year rates are calculated the same way, counting those who graduated with a regular high school diploma within five and six years, respectively.

        <b>Attendance Rate:</b> The average percentage of days a student attended school that year.<br><br>
        <b>AbsenteeRate5:</b> Percentage of students who were absent between zero and four days and who were registered to attend a single school, one or more schools in a county, or one or more schools in Maryland for at least 90 days.<br><br>
        <b>AbsenteeRate20:</b> Percentage of students who were absent 21 days or more and who were registered to attend a single school, one or more schools in a county, or one or more schools in Maryland for at least 90 days.<br><br>
        <b>Chronic Absenteeism:</b> The chronic absenteeism measure identifies the number of students who are expected to attend school for at least 10 days and who were absent 10% or more of the school days while enrolled at that school. For example, a student who is registered to attend a school for 30 days and who is absent 3 of those 30 days is considered chronically absent.

    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        Going into this project, Trista and I had a couple of assumptions of how COVID-19 has affected student life. 
        We both were aware of how much time the average student missed from school and how detrimental that lapse in school can be. 
        We both assumed that COVID-19 has affected students negatively, however we were both curious as to what the magnitude of this effect was. 
        That was the initial inspiration behind creating this dashboard.<br><br>
        <b>Findings</b><br><br>
        Generally speaking, we observed quite significant declines in student performance and retention in a multitude of different areas. 
        While many of these metrics displayed a gradual decline, it looks as though these declines worsened after or around 2019. 
        We observed increased rates of decline after 2019 in SAT scores, graduation rates, enrollment rates, NAEP perfromance, and other performance indicators. 
        We also observed inncreased rates in problematic areas. 
        For example, students are racking up more absences now than ever before in school. 
        We can also see that in both Maryland and Florida, our younger(elementary and early middle school) childeren are behind when looking at student achievement. 
        From our findings, we can confidently say that COVID-19 has had a significantly negative impact on education and student life. 
        In some areas, COVID-19 has erased years of academic progress and has created a myriad of new problems. 
        One positive note that can be taken away from this, however, is that in most areas it does look like students are beginning to recover, which speaks to our resiliency as people.
