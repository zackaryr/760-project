    <h1>The Impact of COVID-19 on Student Enrollment and Performance</h1>
    <p class="intro">The purpose of this dashboard is is to provide context to the impact COVID-19 has had on student enrollment and performance.
        With each graph, there will be a introductory explanation of what you are looking, explanation of how to read and interact with the graph, and our personal conclusions after viewing the data.
        Our visualizations are split between this webpage and Tableau.
        Please view our Tableau visualizations <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/trista3638/viz/collegereadiness2016-2021/Story1?publish=yes" target="_blank">here</a> as these will provide even more information and context surrounding COVID-19 and ist impact on education.

    <p>Michigan School Data<br><br>
        This chart shows the amount of dropouts for each graduation cohort.<br><br>
        Example from mischooldata.org: Students in the 2018 cohort were ninth graders in the 2014-15 school year.
        Their on-time expected graduation was four years later (2018).
        Students in this cohort who graduated in 2018 were counted in the four-year graduation rate; those who did not graduate in 2018 could be counted as dropouts or off-track continuing.
        Five- and six-year rates are calculated the same way, counting those who graduated with a regular high school diploma within five and six years, respectively.
